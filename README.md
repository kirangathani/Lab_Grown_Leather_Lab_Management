# This is a lab grown leather lab management tool

# Planning

*What are the company's R&D objectives?"*
 - Bioreactor runs - run success KPIs
  - What was the growth rate?
  - What is the final composition of the leather? They will have their own tools to quantitatively determine this.
  -  Keep track of the inputs (media costs, electricity costs, bioreactor capex costs)
 - Scalable leather production
  - low cost of leather production at scale.
  - process whose efficacy is maintained as the company scales.

*What does the company need to keep track of?*
 - How well did the batch go?
    - Speed of growth
    - Quality of leather product (quantitatively)
 - SOP related information:
    - person responsible for running the experiment.
    - under GMP a secondary supervisor responsible for signing off on the experiement (maybe this is only for production runs).
    - date
    - experiment set-up identifier (eg: Bioreactor #1)
